# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project predicting the fraudulent transactions based on the given data is  done using programming language R. By analyzing and Visualizing the Credit card  frauds, banks can implement a way to stop the fraud. R is a statistical programming  language and environment for data analysis and visualization. It is open source and  supported by various libraries and packages.  In our minor project work, K-Nearest Neighbor supervised learning algorithms was used to solve this typical classification problem. In this major project, the project is continued by applying Support Vector Machine  and Random Forest Classification Algorithms. Along with it, the feature extraction  processes like greedy search algorithm and random forest feature search process  will be used for acquiring the best accuracy results from a set of selected features.
